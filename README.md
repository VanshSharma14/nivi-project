Currently the code takes a specified section of the worksheet and the algorithm grabs position of the specified values (closest to the intervals of 300ms).
For Example: Between values 297 299 302, it will capture the position of the 299th value.
This was kind of the hardest part of this since the rest of the stuff is just placing numbers around.
